 * into the routing row (verdict + both budgets' arithmetic); `halt` carries
 * the deferred `FailureText` when a limit tripped. Two ledgers, two
 * taxonomies: `run.laps` is the ABSOLUTE per-destination count (every
 * re-entry counts, whatever the `progress` verdict — the `maxLaps + 1`-th
 * re-entry halts on the ceiling, verdict-proof); `run.revisits` is the
 * WAIVE-AWARE count (an "improved" verdict waives the re-entry — no
 * increment, only non-waived re-entries spend the `maxBackwardJumps`
 * cap). So `revisits ≤ laps` always, and both limits trip on the same
 * re-entry only when `maxBackwardJumps ≥ maxLaps`. Arbitration is
 * CEILING-FIRST: the lap compare runs before the improved-waive, so the
 * absolute bound can never be outlived by a verdict.
 *
 * A "backward jump" is a *decision-edge* resolving to an already-visited
 * stage — i.e. a deliberate retry choice. Deterministic forward edges that
 * pass through a cycle (the body of a multi-stage loop) are NOT counted,
 * because they're consequences of the retry decision rather than
 * independent retry events. Without this distinction the cap would trip
 * mid-loop on any cycle longer than 2 stages, burning the entire budget
 * on a single retry iteration's deterministic hops.
 *
 * Each destination owns its budget (`run.revisits`): a stage may be
 * re-entered via decision edges at most `maxBackwardJumps` times, regardless
 * of how many OTHER decision edges the cycle crosses on the way. A shared
 * streak counter would make the effective retry budget a function of the
 * cycle's hop count — inserting a checking stage into a fix loop (a
 * deterministic-floor edge, a confirm arm) silently taxed the fix budget.
 * Per-destination counts are invariant to the cycle's shape, and unrelated
 * loops are independent by construction (different destinations), which is
 * what the old reset-on-escape rule existed to approximate.
 *
 * `state.telemetry.backwardJumps` stays the run-wide cumulative total of
 * decision-edge re-entries — waived or counted (post-hoc telemetry only —
 * never consulted for the halt decision, never reset). The per-destination
 * verdict ring (`run.progressTrail`) records every hook invocation (absent
 * hook ⇒ no entry) and rides the halt text.
 *
 * Trip attribution targets `nextName` (the stage the guard refused to
