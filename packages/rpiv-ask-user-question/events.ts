/**
 * Public event contract for @juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question.
 *
 * STABILITY POLICY — applies to every event in the `rpiv:*` namespace.
 *
 *   1. Channel names are immutable. Once shipped, never rename.
 *   2. Payload changes are append-only. Listeners MUST tolerate unknown
 *      fields. New fields ship as optional (`?:`).
 *   3. Breaking changes (rename, retype, remove a field; change emission
 *      semantics) require a NEW channel, e.g. `rpiv:ask-user:prompt.v2`,
 *      with dual-emit during a deprecation window.
 *   4. No `version` field inside payloads. Version via channel name only.
 *   5. Payloads must be JSON-safe: primitives, arrays, plain objects.
 *      No Set/Map/Date/class instances — payloads must survive JSON
 *      serialization when listeners forward them across process or
 *      network boundaries.
 *
 * Naming: `rpiv:<package-or-tool>:<phase>`, lowercase, hyphen-separated.
 * Aligns with Pi's `"my-extension:status"` example and UniPi's `unipi:*`.
