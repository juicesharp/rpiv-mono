# Changelog

All notable changes to `@juicesharp/rpiv-pi` are documented here.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-18

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-18

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- `@juicesharp/rpiv-btw` registered as a sibling plugin. `/rpiv-setup` now installs it, session-start warns when missing, and the README documents the new `/btw` command (ask a side question without polluting the main conversation).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- `explore` skill steps reformatted as `### Step N:` H3 headings (matching `discover`); Step 2.5 promoted to Step 3 with 3–8 cascaded to 4–9.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `--rpiv-debug` flag surfaces injected guidance and git-context messages for troubleshooting extension behavior.
- `explore` skill restructured into an option-shopping flow: generates 2–4 named candidates, confirms via a Step 2.5 checkpoint, and supports a no-fit recommendation branch.

## [0.4.x]

### Fixed
- `/rpiv-setup pi install` spawn failure on Windows.
- `git-context` showing branch as commit hash.
- Skill-pipeline description corrected: `review` → `validate`.
- `saveAdvisorConfig` error handling and effort-picker fallback index.

### Changed
- Provider setup moved to optional prereq; added Pi Agent install instructions to the README.
- Peer dependencies cleaned up (dropped `pi-ai`, `pi-tui`, `typebox`).

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- Bundled agents sync by content diff with manifest tracking.
- Git user and git-context messages injected per session, deduplicated across the lifecycle.
- Root guidance injected at session start; subfolder `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` surfaced via per-depth resolver.
- `CLAUDE.md` migration path to `.rpiv/guidance/` tree.

### Changed
- Tools extracted into sibling `@juicesharp` Pi plugins (`ask-user-question`, `todo`, `advisor`, `web-tools`). `rpiv-pi` is now pure infrastructure.
- Skills renamed to a bare-verb convention (`/skill:research`, `/skill:design`, `/skill:plan`, …).

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- Advisor tool + `/advisor` command with reasoning effort picker, an "off" option, and model+effort persistence across sessions.
- CC-parity todo tool: 4-state machine (pending → in_progress → completed + deleted), `blockedBy` dependency graph, and a persistent overlay widget with status glyphs.
- Custom overlay for `ask-user-question` (themed borders, accent header, explicit keybinding hints).

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- Initial Pi extension: 9 agents and 21 skills covering the full discover → research → design → plan → implement → validate pipeline.
